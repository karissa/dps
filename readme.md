# dps (data per second)

Search, manage, and update datasets. **This is half vaporware right now.**

With open data comes a price. It's difficult to track and manage all of the urls and APIs that provide data. Harvesting data for a simple query like 'city water' will become a nightmare, let alone if you have custom scraping processes to clean that data after it's downloaded! How do you know when the source data has changed? Enter DPS.

## Developer install
```
git clone https://github.com/karissa/dps.git
cd dps
npm install
```

## Example

```
dps add http://www.opendatacache.com/cookcounty.socrata.com/api/geospatial/26nm-wd5q cookcounty.geo
```

This puts the following entry into `dps.json`:
```
{
  location: 'http://www.opendatacache.com/cookcounty.socrata.com/api/geospatial/26nm-wd5q',
  type: 'url',
  name: 'cookcounty.geo',
  size: 618400,
  meta: {

    checked: Tue Sep 22 2015 01:51:43 GMT-0700 (PDT)
  }
}
```

Then I can add another one..

```
$ dps add http://eukaryota.dathub.org/
```

And this is also added to the `dps.json`:

```
{
  location: 'http://eukaryota.dathub.org',
  type: 'dat',
  size: 4059
  name: 'eukaryota',
  description: 'some description',
  publisher: 'maxogden',
  meta: {

    checked: Tue Sep 22 2015 01:52:57 GMT-0700 (PDT),
  }
}
```

  * `dps update/` will triger the re-download of this data

### `dps update [dataset] [--trackers]`
  * updates a given dataset, or all datasets.
  * fetches the dataset via the given HTTP url
  * `--trackers` updates only the trackers, not the data.

### `dps status`
  * see list of all tracked data
  * --trackers lists only trackers

### `dps rm <name>`
  * removes a tracked source from the list
