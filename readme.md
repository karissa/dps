Search and manage datasets. This is mostly vaporware at the moment.

With open data comes a price. Tracking and managing many urls from which you harvest data APIs can be a nightmare, let alone if you have custom scraping processes to clean that data!

Enter dps.

### dps add <name/url>
  * name will be found through any 'tracked' registries.
  * url could be the url of anything that gives data with HTTP GET

### dps list
  * see list of all tracked data

### dps create <command>
  * create a scraper
  * instead of adding a url, add a local scraper.
  * will have to specify the command to run. the command should output data on stdout

### dps search <keyword>
  * does a search through the tracker metadata

### dps update [dataset] [--trackers]
  * updates a given dataset, or all datasets.
  * fetches the dataset via the given HTTP url
  * `--trackers` updates only the trackers, not the data.

### dps track <url>
  * add a tracker that will be searchable through 'dps search'

### dps trackers
  * see all trackers

### dps publish <url> <tracker>
  * publish the url to a given tracker
